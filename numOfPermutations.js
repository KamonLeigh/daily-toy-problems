/* 
Write a function that takes a number or a string and gives back the number of permutations without repetitions that can generated using all of its element.; more on permutations here.

For example, starting with:

1
45
115
"abc"
You could respectively generate:

1
45,54
115,151,511
"abc","acb","bac","bca","cab","cba"
So you should have, in turn:

perms(1)==1
perms(45)==2
perms(115)==3
perms("abc")==6
*/

/*
O: Number
I: Number or string
C: 
  Time: O(n!) Factorial - Quadratic
E: 
  1      => 1
  45     => 2
  115    => 3
  'abc'  => 6
