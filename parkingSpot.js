There are N+1 parking spots, numbered from 0 to N. There are N cars numbered from 1 to N parked in various parking spots with one left empty. Reorder the cars so that car #1 is in spot #1, car #2 is in spot #2 and so on. Spot #0 will remain empty. The only allowed operation is to take a car and move it to the free spot.‚Äù

Write down 5 different examples and try to order the cars on a sheet of paper.
